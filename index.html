<h3>What is a Drone?</h3>
<h4>A Drone is an unmanned aircraft,
    Here we are specifically talking about <strong>Quadcopers</strong> <br>which are drones
	usually with an X frame and 4 propellers.<br> These drones are controlled using radio transmitters. </h4>
	 
	 <h5>There are 4 main types of Quadcopters</h5>

  <p> 
    - Photography Quadcopters <br>
    - Toy Quadcopters<br>
    - Racing Quadcopters<br>
	- Delivery Quadopters<br>
  </p>
<h6> We will be focusing on photgraphy Quads <br>
    Photography Quads are the most epensive type of quadcopters <br>they are used for making movies and videos.<br> Photography Drones are equipped with a FPV (first person view)system<br> which by WIFI sends the video from the quad to the screen/phone attached to the controller
	<br> so you can get your shots right and dont need to to see the drone to be able to fly it. </h6>
