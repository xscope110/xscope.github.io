<h3>What is a Drone?</h3>
  <h5>
    <p>A Drone is an unmanned aircraft,
      Here we are specifically talking about <strong>Quadcopers</strong> which are drones<br> usually with an X frame with 4 propellers. These drones are controlled using radio transmitters.</p> <br>
    There are 3 types of Quadcopters
    <ul>
    <li>Photography Quadcopters</li> <br>
     <li>Toy Quadcopters</li> <br>
    <li>Racing Quadcopters</li><br>
  </ul>
    We will be focusing on photgraphy Quads <br>
    <p>Photography Quads are the most epensive type of quadcopters they are used for making movies and videos.<br> Photography Drones are equipped with a FPV (first person view)system which by WIFI sends the video from<br> the quad to the screen/phone attached to the controller so you can get your shots right and dont need to to see<br> the drone to be able to fly it. </p>
